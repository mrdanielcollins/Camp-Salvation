  <!-- Mission statement / goals-->
  <div class="main-content border">
    <p class="mission-text">The purpose of Camp Salvation is “to evangelize, to educate, and to train in
      the art of Christian living, with special emphases on the work among young people.”
      All day every day we have activities, games, meals and services that all have a purpose
      in the bigger plan of either bringing young people into a relationship with Jesus Christ,
      or training those who already know Him how to live for Him. These are the same basic goals
      that every body of believers should have. However, there is something powerful about getting
      away into the mountains and away from all the distractions that usually come between us and
      our Creator.

    <h1>Statement Of Faith</h1>
    <hr>
    <div id="faith-flex">
      <p>
        The Bible, which is verbally inspired by the Holy Spirit and inerrant in the original manuscript is the
        infallible
        and authoritative Word of God. <br /><br />

        The Triune Godhead in three Persons – Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. <br /><br />

        The personality of Satan, called the devil, and his present control over unregenerate mankind. <br /><br />

        The fall and lost estate of man, whose total depravity makes necessary the new birth. you must receive the
        Christ
        personally by faith. We believe that all the redeemed once saves are kept by God’s power and thus secure in
        Christ
        forever. (John 10:28-29; 5:24) <br /><br />

        The deity of Jesus Christ, His virgin birth, sinless life, death, bodily resurrection, present exaltation at
        God’s
        right hand, and personal and imminent return. We believe in His personal pre-tribulationary rapture and
        pre-millennial return to earth. <br /><br />

        The atonement by the substitutionary death and shed blood of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior. <br /><br />

  
        The resurrection of the saved unto everlasting life and blessedness in heaven, and the resurrection of the
        unsaved
        unto everlasting punishment into the lake of fire. <br /><br />

        The church, the body, or the bride of Christ, consisting only of those who are born again, for whom He now makes
        intercession in Heaven and for whom He shall come again. <br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Christ’s commission to the church to go into all the world and preach the gospel. <br /><br />

        We are not in agreement with the ecumenical movement. <br /><br />

        That we are called with a holy calling to walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit (Rom. 8:12-13, 13:14; I
        Peter 1:14-16) and so to live in the Spirit that we shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh (Eph. 4:22-24), but
        the flesh being in us to the end of our earthly pilgrimage (I John 1:8) needs to be kept constantly in
        subjection
        to Christ (Col. 3:1-10) through the operating of the Holy Spirit (Gal. 5:22-23), or it will surely manifest its
        presence to the dishonor of His name (Gal. 5:17-21) <br /><br />

        That the gift of speaking in tongues was temporary and ceased with the completion of the canon of scriptures (I
        Cor. 13:8-10), that the speaking in tongues is separate from the other gifts or ministries of the Holy Spirit,
        such as regeneration (Titus 3:5), indwelling (I John 4:13), baptism (I Cor. 12:13), filling and sealing (Eph.
        5:8,
        1:13-14, 4:30), that all New Testament believers are baptized by the Holy Spirit at the moment of conversion (I
        Cor. 12:13; Rom. 8:9) <br /><br />

        We recognize baptism and the Lord’s Supper. We believe that both of these privileges are for believers only and
        that they are signs only, with no saving grace or merit in them. We believe that baptism should by by immersion,
        and these ordinances are the responsibility of the local churches to conduct. (Matt. 3:16; Mark 1:9-10; Rom.
        6:3-4; I Cor. 11:23-29<br /><br />

          <p>I love Camp Salvation! We brought the students from our church in 2014 and we were hooked! This camp is
            unlike any other experience! I love how our camp is focused on relationships, especially the most important
            relationship with our Lord & Savior Jesus Christ.

            My wife, Janna, and I have served in churches in both Arkansas and Colorado. We’ve been married for 23 years
            and have two kids, Josh and Rachel, who also help out in the ministry. I’ve served as the Associate Pastor
            at River of Grace Church in Pueblo West since 2005. I have also been teaching music at Swallows Charter
            Academy in Pueblo West since 2008.
