      <h4>Our Goal</h4>
      <hr>
      <p class="mission-text">The purpose of Camp Salvation is “to evangelize, to educate, and to train in 
        the art of Christian living, with special emphases on the work among young people.”  
        All day every day we have activities, games, meals and services that all have a purpose 
        in the bigger plan of either bringing young people into a relationship with Jesus Christ, 
        or training those who already know Him how to live for Him. These are the same basic goals 
        that every body of believers should have. However, there is something powerful about getting 
        away into the mountains and away from all the distractions that usually come between us and 
        our Creator. 
        </p>
    <h4>Statement Of Faith</h4>
    <hr>
    <p class="mission-text">
        The Bible, which is verbally inspired by the Holy Spirit and inerrant in the original manuscript is the infallible and authoritative Word of God. <br/><br/>

        The Triune Godhead in three Persons – Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. <br/><br/>
        
        The personality of Satan, called the devil, and his present control over unregenerate mankind. <br/><br/>
        
        The fall and lost estate of man, whose total depravity makes necessary the new birth. you must receive the Christ personally by faith. We believe that all the redeemed once saves are kept by God’s power and thus secure in Christ forever. (John 10:28-29; 5:24)  <br/><br/>
        
        The deity of Jesus Christ, His virgin birth, sinless life, death, bodily resurrection, present exaltation at God’s right hand, and personal and imminent return. We believe in His personal pre-tribulationary rapture and pre-millennial return to earth. <br/><br/>
        
        The atonement by the substitutionary death and shed blood of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior. <br/><br/>
        
        The resurrection of the saved unto everlasting life and blessedness in heaven, and the resurrection of the unsaved unto everlasting punishment into the lake of fire. <br/><br/>
        
        The church, the body, or the bride of Christ, consisting only of those who are born again, for whom He now makes intercession in Heaven and for whom He shall come again. <br/><br/>
        
        Christ’s commission to the church to go into all the world and preach the gospel. <br/><br/>
        
        We are not in agreement with the ecumenical movement. <br/><br/>
        
        That we are called with a holy calling to walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit (Rom. 8:12-13, 13:14; I Peter 1:14-16) and so to live in the Spirit that we shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh (Eph. 4:22-24), but the flesh being in us to the end of our earthly pilgrimage (I John 1:8) needs to be kept constantly in subjection to Christ (Col. 3:1-10) through the operating of the Holy Spirit (Gal. 5:22-23), or it will surely manifest its presence to the dishonor of His name (Gal. 5:17-21) <br/><br/>
        
        That the gift of speaking in tongues was temporary and ceased with the completion of the canon of scriptures (I Cor. 13:8-10), that the speaking in tongues is separate from the other gifts or ministries of the Holy Spirit, such as regeneration (Titus 3:5), indwelling (I John 4:13), baptism (I Cor. 12:13), filling and sealing (Eph. 5:8, 1:13-14, 4:30), that all New Testament believers are baptized by the Holy Spirit at the moment of conversion (I Cor. 12:13; Rom. 8:9) <br/><br/>
        
        We recognize baptism and the Lord’s Supper. We believe that both of these privileges are for believers only and that they are signs only, with no saving grace or merit in them. We believe that baptism should by by immersion, and these ordinances are the responsibility of the local churches to conduct. (Matt. 3:16; Mark 1:9-10; Rom. 6:3-4; I Cor. 11:23-29)g<br/><br/>

          <h5 class="card-title">Director</h5><p>My name is Tim Muth and I have been married to my wonderful wife, Joy since 2000. We have been blessed with two children who love attending Camp with us, Mark and Stephanie. I have been involved with Camp Salvation since 2005. I started out as a counselor, song leader, and game leader and took over as a director of the Sr. High and Intermediate weeks in 2008.

              Youth Ministry is a passion for me and is what I went to school for at Northland Baptist Bible College in Wisconsin. I have been the Youth Pastor and Awana Director at La Junta Baptist Tabernacle following college in 1998 until now. I work a full time job at Muth Welding Service in Rocky Ford, CO, and love seeing God work in people’s lives. Camp Salvation is a unique camp and very special to my heart. I have seen God do miraculous things at Camp Salvation each year and look forward to seeing what God will do this year at Camp!</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Director</h5> <p>I love Camp Salvation!  We brought the students from our church in 2014 and we were hooked!  This camp is unlike any other experience!  I love how our camp is focused on relationships, especially the most important relationship with our Lord & Savior Jesus Christ.

                My wife, Janna, and I have served in churches in both Arkansas and Colorado.  We’ve been married for 23 years and have two kids, Josh and Rachel, who also help out in the ministry.  I’ve served as the Associate Pastor at River of Grace Church in Pueblo West since 2005.  I have also been teaching music at Swallows Charter Academy in Pueblo West since 2008.
                
                I’m excited to be able to help Camp Salvation by directing the Junior Weeks!  It’s a blessing to serve with Tim and the rest of the staff.
