                Admissions: Rules for acceptance are the same for everyone without regard to race, color, nationality,
                gender, religion, or disability. Camp Salvation is not a treatment center and all our staff are
                volunteers. They are not necessarily trained to deal with campers who have severe mental, physical, or
                emotional difficulties. We would ask that any families sending campers who need one-to-one, special
                attention to function at camp, would send an adult sponsor with them so that their unique needs are not
                neglected. Their one-to-one adult sponsor would need to apply as a volunteer staff and will function as
                the cabin’s second adult sponsor, with the clarification that they would be specifically responsible for
                the camper with special needs.
                <br />
                <br />

                Cabin counselors could have up to twelve campers in their charge and if one requires constant, special
                attention, it could cause unintended neglect for those special needs, or the needs of the others. If a
                campers’ special needs are not severe enough to need one-to-one care , we ask that you contact Kendra
                England, Secretary, or Tim Muth, Director, to make us aware of any situations we may need to be aware of
                to provide for campers in the best way possible. It is our desire to deal with each camper appropriately
                to their needs. Our goal is to serve each individual camper and encourage each of them to take their
                next
                spiritual step while at Camp.
                <br />
                <br />

                For the safety and well-being of our campers we do reserve the right to refuse admission to our
                programs,
                in appropriate cases; per the General Rules for Child Care Facilities 7.701.14 and 7.702.61c. Please
                contact us with questions or concerns.
                <br />
                <br />

                Registration Process: Registrations must be postmarked by May 15th to receive the pre-registration
                discount. It is advised that you call for bed availability after that date. As weeks reach capacity,
                campers may be placed on a waiting list. Campers may only register for one week. It is our desire to
                serve
                as many campers as we can. If your camper is interested in attending a second week, you may indicate
                that
                on this form but understand that they will be placed on a waiting list for their second choice. You will
                be notified a week before if there is availability.

                <br />
                <br />
                Day of Admissions Process: Transporting adults will check their campers in at the Office. Upon arrival
                to
                Camp, all paperwork will be checked to ensure it is correct and complete. Transporting adults will turn
                in
                all medications (including over the counter medications) to the nurse, who will do a quick health check.
                This is not a physical. Please keep campers home if they are sick or have lice.

                <br />
                <br />
                Cancellation and Dismissal Policy: Cancellations made more than two weeks before the date registered
                will
                be refunded. Any cancellation after that time will only be refunded for medical reasons and must be
                accompanied by a letter from the attending physician. Camp Salvation reserves the right to dismiss any
                camper whom the staff believes presents a safety concern, medial risk, is disruptive, or otherwise
                conducts themselves in a manner detrimental to the camp community, no refund will be issued in the case
                of
                dismissals.

                <br />
                <br />
                Camp Rules and Expected Behavior: Campers should be coming to camp with the intention to grow closer to
                God, meet new people, and have fun. Campers are expected to participate and get the most of every
                activity
                at Camp. Phones are not to be a distraction. Don’t bring a bad attitude to Camp or a desire to do wrong.
                We want you to hear God better while at Camp Salvation.

                <br />
                <br />
                Clothes: The dress code at Camp is the same for everyone so that we are not distraction to each other.
                No
                sleeveless shirts, all shorts need to come to the knee, and no tight or revealing clothing.
                Prohibited Items: There is zero toleration for drugs, tobacco, or alcohol. Please leave any “noise” that
                keeps you from hearing God at Camp, for example: non-Christian music, headphones, and video games. Leave
                valuables at home. The only reason a camper should bring food with them is for medical reasons. This
                exception should be discussed with Camp Staff prior to registration.
