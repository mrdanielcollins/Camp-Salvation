            Founded by the American Sunday School Union and governed by a Board of Directors, 
            Camp Salvation has been hosting camps for youth since 1952. Today, the Board is 
            made up of delegates who represent a co-op of like-minded churches, who all play a 
            significant part of this unique camp. Through generous donations, dedicated volunteerism,
             and constant support, we have had the privilege of offering campers a great camping experience 
             for less than $100 per camper. These campers have been touched by the hand of God at camp, in 
             their churches, and have gone to serve Him in their hometowns and all over the world. Our 
             goal at camp is to create a safe environment where campers feel loved and accepted, and 
             where it is easy to hear God speaking to them.

            Our goal at camp is to create a safe environment where campers and staff feel loved 
            and accepted, this includes food that is safe for them. Because we operate with a volunteer

            Our space is limited and we ask that you do not bring food to camp unless it is a medical

            used: Bible apps, a camera, alarm clock, checking-in with family, and other good 
            things. We ask that campers be responsible and choose not to be distracted by their 
            phones. If needing to call home, we ask that campers let their counselor know they 
            will be making a phone call. If you choose to not leave your camper with a phone, 
            that is great! And we have a phone available for them to use as needed.
